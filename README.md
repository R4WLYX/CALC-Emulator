CALC Emulator.
-
The CALC Emulator is a Console App that can assemble a custom made assembly code to a custom machine code and can also execute the machine code. <br>
The output machine code of this assembler/emulator is used in my minecraft hexadecimal redstone computer (CALC). <br>
This assembler uses `.asc` files and converts them to `.smc` files. <br>

Writing a ASC code.
-
1. Create a new `.asc` file.
2. Creat a `Main:` method to start of with.
3. alternatively you can use the `base.asc` file.
4. To make a method use `def` followed by method name.
5. Then add a `RTN` instruction at the end of the method.
6. To call this method in the `Main:` method use `CAL` followed by method pointer.

Example ASC code.

Example code can be found in the <a href="CALC-Emulator/example">`example`</a> folder.
