The CALC Emulator is a Console App that can assemble a custom made assembly code to a custom machine code and can also execute the machine code.
The output machine code of this assembler/emulator will be used in a minecraft hexadecimal redstone computer.
This assembler uses ".asc" files and converts them to ".smc" files.
Example code can be found in the "example" folder.

To start writing and assembling an assembly code, you can use the base file "base.asc".
